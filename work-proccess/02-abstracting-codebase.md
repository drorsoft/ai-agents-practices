# Abstracting the Codebase (existing code)
 

 You can use a tool like [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) to help streamline your codebase management.

 Another option is to use An AI Agent using the following prompt:

 ```prompt
Please analyze the repository and identify the following key aspects:

Main Technologies: Identify the primary programming languages, frameworks, and tools used.
Used Packages and Their Versions: List the dependencies or packages along with their versions from configuration files (e.g., package.json, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, etc.).
Technical Documentation Reports: Summarize any technical documentation (e.g., README.md, docs/, or other markdown files).
APIs: Extract details about APIs defined or used in the repository, including endpoints, input/output formats, and protocols.
Coding Conventions: Identify coding standards or guidelines followed in this repository (e.g., style guides, linting configurations).
Provide a concise and organized report summarizing the above findings.

put the report in a file called `repo_analysis-for-agents.md` in the docs folder.
 ```
 
 This will help you get a good overview of the codebase and its structure, making it easier to work with and understand.
