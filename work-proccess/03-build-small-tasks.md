# Build Small Defined Tasks
 
>  Now that you have a AI-friendly description of the codebase, it's time to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. This will help you and your team work more efficiently and effectively. Here are some steps to follow:

## Characteristics of a Good Task
- **Small**: The task should be small enough to be completed in a short amount of time (e.g., a few hours to a day).
- **Well-defined**: The task should have a clear goal and outcome. It should be easy to understand what needs to be done and how to do it.
- **Testable**: The task should be easy to test and verify once it's completed. This will help ensure that the code is working as expected and that any bugs are caught early.

You should start a prompt with the following:
```prompt
I would like to define a task. This task should be small, well-defined, and testable. The task is as follows:
<task description>
If my task is not small, well-defined, and testable, please let me know how to break it down into smaller tasks.
otherwise, please provide a detailed plan for completing the task and save it as a markdown file in the `tasks` folder.  
```
