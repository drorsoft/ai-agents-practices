# Practical guide for AI Agents use and Best Practices  

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive set of best practices for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining code with AI agents across various applications and domains.  

## Purpose

I want developers to be able to create understand and maintain code with AI agents. This document serves as a guide for developers to follow when using AI agents, ensuring that they adhere to best practices and standards.

## Core Concepts and Terminology

### What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a software entity that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In a development context, AI agents typically combine:

- **Models**: The underlying AI/ML systems (LLMs, specialized models)
- **Tools**: Functions, APIs, or services the agent can use
- **Memory**: Capability to store and recall information
- **Planning**: Ability to break down complex tasks into manageable steps


## Practical Implementation Guidelines

### Scenario 2: Development Workflow Assistant

Create an agent that assists throughout the development process from requirements gathering to testing and deployment.
s
**Workflow Integration:**
1. Requirements clarification - and documentation
2. Architecture suggestion - and design documentation
3. Code generation with documentation
4. Test case generation
5. Code review assistance
6. Deployment checklist verification
