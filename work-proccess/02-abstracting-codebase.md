# Abstracting the Codebase (existing code)
 

 You can use a tool like [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) to help streamline your codebase management.

 Another option is to use An AI Agent using the following prompt:

Please perform a comprehensive analysis of this repository to create a developer-friendly overview. Explore and identify the following key aspects:

## Technical Architecture
- **Main Technologies**: Identify all programming languages with their approximate usage percentage, frameworks, libraries, and tools used throughout the codebase.
- **System Architecture**: Outline the high-level architecture of the application/system, including components, services, and their relationships.
- **Build and Deployment**: Analyze the build pipeline, deployment configurations, and environment setup (Docker, CI/CD, etc.).

## Dependencies
- **Package Analysis**: List all dependencies with their versions from configuration files (package.json, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, Gemfile, etc.).
- **Third-party Integrations**: Identify external services or APIs integrated with the system.
- **Development Dependencies**: Separate out testing, linting, and other development-only packages.

## Documentation & Project Structure
- **Project Organization**: Map the directory structure with descriptions of key folders and their purpose.
- **Technical Documentation**: Summarize existing documentation (README.md, docs/, wikis, etc.), noting important setup instructions and guides.
- **Comments Quality**: Assess the quality and comprehensiveness of code comments throughout the project.

## Code Quality & Patterns
- **Coding Conventions**: Identify coding standards, style guides, and linting configurations.
- **Design Patterns**: Recognize common design patterns implemented in the codebase.
- **Testing Approach**: Evaluate the testing strategy, coverage, and types of tests (unit, integration, e2e).

## APIs & Data Models
- **API Endpoints**: Document all API endpoints, their request/response formats, authentication methods, and protocols.
- **Data Models**: Identify key data structures, schemas, and their relationships.
- **State Management**: Analyze how application state is managed (if applicable).

## Performance & Security
- **Performance Considerations**: Note any performance optimizations or concerns.
- **Security Mechanisms**: Identify authentication, authorization methods, and other security practices.

## Developer Experience
- **Development Setup**: Summarize the steps required to set up the development environment.
- **Common Workflows**: Identify common development workflows (build, test, deploy).

Please provide a well-organized report with these findings in Markdown format, using code snippets, tables, and sections where appropriate for clarity. Create this report in a file called `repo_analysis-for-agents.md` in the docs folder.
 ```
 
 This will help you get a good overview of the codebase and its structure, making it easier to work with and understand.
